# plotImps
Plot imputed vs. observed values to facilitate multiple imputation diagnostics

This function creates superimposed kernel density plots or barplots (as appropriate) to allow visual comparison of imputed and observed data.
These plots are intended to help check the sanity of multiply imputed data.
